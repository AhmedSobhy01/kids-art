# KidsArt: C++ Drawing Program (Paint for Kids) 🎨

Welcome to KidsArt, an exciting C++ drawing and painting program created to foster creativity and learning among children. Developed as a part of the Programming Techniques course during our first year of Computer Engineering at Cairo University, KidsArt is more than just a drawing tool; it's an interactive and educational experience for young minds.

## Features 🚀

- **Drawing Shapes:** Kids can unleash their imagination by drawing various shapes, including circles, hexagons, rectangles, squares, and triangles.

- **Color Customization:** The application allows users to customize the outline color and background color, providing endless possibilities for artistic expression.

- **Shape Manipulation:** Children can easily move and resize shapes by dragging, encouraging experimentation and spatial awareness.

- **Undo & Redo:** KidsArt incorporates an intuitive undo and redo functionality, allowing young artists to correct mistakes and experiment fearlessly.

- **Recording Functionality:** The program features a recording option, enabling children to capture their entire drawing process.

- **Save & Load:** Drawings can be saved to a file for future reference, fostering a sense of accomplishment, and loaded whenever children want to continue their creative work.

- **Play Mode:** In Play Mode, KidsArt becomes an educational tool, engaging children with questions about their drawings. This mode adds an element of fun while enhancing their cognitive skills.

## About Us 🙌

This project was a collaborative effort by a team of four enthusiastic computer engineering students from Cairo University. As a pivotal assignment in our "Programming Techniques" course, KidsArt gave us practical insights into applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a real-world project.

## Learning Highlights 📚

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** KidsArt is a testament to our understanding and application of OOP concepts, demonstrating how they can be effectively employed to model shapes, actions, and the overall structure of an application.

- **Static & Dynamic Binding:** Through developing the drawing tool, we gained hands-on experience with both static and dynamic binding in C++.

- **Action Design Pattern:** The implementation of the Action design pattern in the application manager showcases our ability to handle various user interactions efficiently.
